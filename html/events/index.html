				<h3>Soda Rock Winery</h3>
				<p>We're members at a few wineries around the area, and had even found a club to join before we found an apartment to rent!</p>
				<p>We joined the wine club at <a href="http://www.delorimierwinery.com/" class="external">deLorimier</a> after learning that it and a few others are part of the <a href="http://www.delorimierwinery.com/pages/wilson-artisan-wineries" class="external">Wilson Artisan Wineries</a> group and share reciprocal benefits, like discounts on tastings and invitation to events.  Everybody we've met has been super friendly, so hopefully you're able to stop by one (or a few) of the wineries for a tasting while you're in town.</p>
				<p><a href="http://www.sodarockwinery.com/" class="external">Soda Rock</a> is another Wilson Family winery, and was built in the late 1800s as a general store, the local post office, and eventually a small schoolhouse.  Recently, the stone facade, rustic barn, and grounds were renovated and we love their beautiful location in the Alexander Valley.</p>
