				<h1>About Us</h1>
			</header>

			<section id="us">
				<p>Like many of our friends, Claire and Joe came from different parts of the country and met through friends in school at Northwestern University.</p>
				<p>Claire, daughter of Trudy Schoepko, grew up in Albuquerque, NM, where she studied viola and was active in speech and debate.  She went on to study viola performance and played with the Civic Orchestra of Chicago before changing careers and focusing on personal training and physical therapy.</p>
				<p>Joe, son of Chip and Vicky Morrow, grew up in Rock Island, IL, where he played trombone and was on the speech team.  He studied computer science and was a member of the "Wildcat" Marching Band at Northwestern, where he later worked as a webmaster and web developer.</p>

				<p>We lived in Chicago for a few years after graduation, enjoying 'Cats' games and time with our friends, before Claire moved to Las Vegas, NV, to earn a Doctor of Physical Therapy degree from Touro University, and Joe remained in Chicago as the leader of a successful Front-End Development practice.</p>
				<p>Claire understandably declined to move back from summery Las Vegas to Chicago after graduation, so we both relocated to San Francisco to start our new lives together and to enjoy down jackets and farmers' markets every week of the year.</p>

				<p>Today, Claire practices Physical Therapy at Google's headquarters in Mountain View, and Joe is self-employed as a user experience strategy and product design consultant (hire him!).  When Joe isn't traveling for work and Claire isn't training for an Ironman Triathlon, we enjoy exploring our new city and the Sonoma County wine country.  We live with our two kitties, Ichabod and Coal, in the Marina District in San Francisco, and baby our Meyer Lemon tree.</p>

				<h2>Our Wedding Party</h2>
				<dl>
					<dt>Kristen Prentiss, <span>Maid of Honor</span></dt>
					<dd>Claire and Kristen met at Eldorado high school and became great friends in Mr. O'Grady's history class. Despite Kristen moving all over the world every 2 or 3 years, Claire and Kristen have always found time for regular phone calls and visits. They have a two call rule: if you get a call from the other and are busy you can wait, but if you get a second call right away, you drop everything to answer the phone. Kristen and her husband, Jake, just welcomed their beautiful baby boy, William, to the world.</dd>

					<dt>Carrie Hobbs Schulman</dt>
					<dd>Carrie and her husband, Dan, were two of Claire and Joe's best friends in Chicago until they moved to the Bay Area.  We both fell in love with the area when we visited for their wedding September of 2009.  Carrie and Joe first met in their Freshman dorm, Sargent, and as members of the marching band. Their presence in the area has been invaluable for our transition moving to San Francisco. Right now, Carrie is very busy keeping track of their son, Owen.</dd>

					<dt>Amanda Warren</dt>
					<dd>Claire and Amanda (aka Mandie) became close friends as sorority sisters in Sigma Alpha Iota.  Claire's first apartment in Chicago after college was the apartment Mandie vacated to move to Boston to attend graduate school for speech language pathology.  Claire was secretly hoping Mandie would hate Boston and come back to Chicago, but Mandie found her home in Boston, where she lives with her wonderful husband, Ben, and their daughter Olivia.</dd>

					<dt>Dorothy Schalk, <span>Sister of the Groom</span></dt>
					<dd>Dorothy has been Joe's sister for practically forever.  She works as an interior designer and lives in Rock Island with her husband, Ben, their beautiful new son, Charlie, and enormous cat, Felix, who occasionally enjoys kitty parties.</dd>

					<dt>Jonathan Hawkins, <span>Best Man</span></dt>
					<dd>PFC Hawkins has been stationed both as a Naval JAG lawyer in Afghanistan and as a roommate in a Chicago apartment with Joe and Heff.  He is an avid fan of both 'Cats and country, and lives with his wife, Mary, and their dog, Sadie Hawkins, inside the Washington, DC, beltway.</dd>

					<dt>Daniel "Heff" Heffner</dt>
					<dd>A former roommate of both Joe and Claire, Heff could plausibly be one of the only people who could claim to have introduced us.  Whether it really happened that way is lost to the shifting sands of time, but he, along with Steph and their two precious kitties, Possum and Bruiser, have been like a part of our family.</dd>

					<dt>Jimmy Long, <span>Brother of the Bride</span></dt>
					<dd>Jimmy came along about 19 months into Claire's life.  For the next 14 years, Claire was convinced that he had ruined everything.  Then, during high school, as members of the speech and debate team, Claire learned to not only tolerate her baby brother, but appreciate him as a life-long, true friend.  She remembers nights staying up too late with him just talking.  She now considers Jimmy one of her closest friends and is grateful to have found that in her brother.  Jimmy currently resides in Hollywood with his beautiful wife, Erin, and their two cats, Ace and Cally.</dd>
