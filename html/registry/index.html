				<p>Above all else, we hope you're able to join us in Wine Country and very much look forward to celebrating with you in person!</p>
				<p>In the last year, we've managed to squeeze together the full households we separately maintained into our one-bedroom city apartment, so we fortunately don't need a lot of basics.  We've been starting to dream about having a tiny weekend retreat up in Sonoma County to which we'll banish some of our well-loved but mismatched housewares, and so we only need a few things to help us furnish our apartment and enjoy our time together and with you.</p>
				<p>Like any self-respecting Bay Area tech-industry couple, our wedding registry is operated by a tech start-up company, <a href="http://www.zola.com/" class="external">Zola</a>.  Hopefully they don't go out of business before our wedding.  <em>(Kidding!)</em></p>

			<section id="instructions">
				<h2>Here's How this Works:</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>We've carefully selected a few things we need from several different stores, both in person and online.</li>
					<li>Zola aggregates all of the items into <a href="registry.php" class="external">this list</a> so you can see everything at once and don't have to hunt around a bunch of separate registry sites.</li>
					<li>If you're inspired to give something on our list, please pick out your gift and purchase it through <a href="registry.php" class="external">Zola</a>.  We really appreciate your generosity, and would still love to receive something more personal from you, however it's harder for us to track purchases you make on other sites, and we know most of our guests will be flying out to see us and may be concerned about baggage.</li>
					<li>For some of our larger items, you can make a donation toward the purchase price and the site will help you split the gift with others.  If the full amount isn't met, we can apply your gift to another item on our registry or we can just split the item with you, ourselves.</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			
			<section id="disclaimer">
				<h2>The Fine Print</h2>
				<p>You won't really have to worry about the rest of this, but in case you're interested in why we chose Zola, besides gathering items we like from any other website and from several local stores we visited in person, they automatically convert your gift into a donation that we'll use to purchase the items ourselves.</p>
				<p>It sounds a little weird, but it gives us the flexibility to receive your gifts (in our smallish apartment) when we're ready, to make substitutions if things aren't available, and when we purchase the items ourselves, Joe gets credit card points we can use on our honeymoon.</p>
				<p>Please note that the prices you see already include tax and any costs for shipping to us in San Francisco, and Zola subtracts a nominal credit card processing fee.  Those guys have gotta eat, too.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>Again, we really appreciate your generosity and hope this simplifies things for everybody.</p>
